# The History Behind This Book

The main driver and project manager for the creation of this **free open-source programming book** are **[Dr. Svetlin Nakov](https://nakov.com)**.

In 2014, the SoftUni initiative was launched. In the beginning, these lessons had a larger range and covered more theory. In 2016 Dr. Svetlin Nakov completely reworked, updated, and simplified the whole method of teaching, strongly emphasizing practice. This is how the core of the **learning content of this book was created**.

Following the principle of **free software and free knowledge**, Svetlin Nakov led a **team of volunteers** and started this open-source project. At first, the idea was to create a **free book** for the basics of programming in the C# programming language and later extend the initiative with other similar books in various popular programming languages (like Java, JavaScript and Python).
This book follows the structure of Programming Basics with C# (English).

The project is part of the hard work of the **[Software University Foundation](https://softuni.foundation)** to create and distribute open learning content to teach software engineers and IT professionals.

## Authors Team

This book is developed by a broad author's team of **volunteers** who dedicated their time to give away the systematized knowledge and guide you at the start of programming. Below is a list of the main authors (in alphabetical order):

## The Book That Helps Teachers 

If you are a **teacher of programming**, informatics, or information technology or want **to teach programming**, this book gives you more
than a well-structured learning material with many examples and tasks. **Free of charge** with the book you receive **quality educational content** for teaching in school, in the **Bulgarian language**, by the school requirements:

* **Educational presentations** (PowerPoint slides) for each learning topic tailored to 45-minute hours in schools – free of charge.
* Well-designed **tasks** for class and homework, with detailed conditions and sample entrance and exit – free of charge.
* **An automated task and homework verification system** (Online Judge System) to be used by students, also free of charge.
* **Video lessons** with methodological instructions from the free course for programming teachers, which is held regularly by the SoftUni Foundation.

## Reporting Bugs

If you find **mistakes**, inaccuracies or bugs in the book, you can report them in the official bug tracker of the project:
